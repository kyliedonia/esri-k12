Build skills in problem solving, creative, tackle challenges

build the tools and applications people use
visual rep of spatial data
richer story of the information behind the data
take geospatial data, add code, and make interactive maps and experiences with targetted experiences (in a web page or an app)
solve hard problems and have ah ha moments where things click and you made an application or site behave as you'd expect
interested in coding? Just keep building things and learn through experimenting/failure
hands-on experience making programs
soft skills like collaborate, problem solve
challenged and creative every day
